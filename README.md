### Architecture Overview

DevTinder follows a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Client Layer**
   - Handles user interface and real-time updates
   - Communicates with Express Server via REST APIs
   - Uses Socket.IO for real-time features

2. **Express Server**
   - Central hub for all services
   - Handles API routing and business logic
   - Manages real-time communication

3. **Core Services**
   - **Authentication Service**: User authentication and authorization
   - **Profile Service**: User profiles and data management
   - **Connection Service**: Connection requests and matching
   - **Notification Service**: Real-time updates and email notifications

4. **Data Layer**
   - MongoDB: Stores user data, profiles, and connections
   - JWT: Handles authentication tokens
   - Socket.IO: Enables real-time communication
   - AWS SES: Handles email notifications

This architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and real-time responsiveness while keeping the system modular and easy to extend.
